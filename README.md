# bottleneckcheck

An app that tells you if you are limited by a NAS server, or your computer.

## What is it for?

A busy student house means busy modem. Finding that my two most important devices were being assigned (randomly) different speeds at the modem, I wanted a script that could cut troubleshooting time down.

## What does it work on?

FreeNAS server and Linux system (debian-based).
